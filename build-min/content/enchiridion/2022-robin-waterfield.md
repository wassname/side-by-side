Some things are up to us and some are not. Up to us are judgment, inclination, desire, aversion—in short, whatever is our own doing. Not up to us are our bodies, possessions, reputations, public offices—in short, whatever isn’t our own doing. Moreover, the things that are up to us are naturally free, unimpeded, and unobstructed, while the things that aren’t up to us are weak, enslaved, subject to impediment, and not ours. So remember this: if you regard things that are naturally enslaved as free, if you regard things that are not yours as yours, you’ll be obstructed, dejected, and troubled, and you’ll blame both gods and men. But if you regard as yours only what is yours, and as not yours only what is not yours, which is the way things are in reality, no one will ever constrain you, no one will impede you, you’ll blame no one, you’ll reproach no one, you’ll never act reluctantly, no one will harm you, and you’ll have no enemies, because you’ll never suffer harm.

In setting yourself such great goals, then, bear in mind that no moderate effort is required as you set about attaining them. You’ll have to let some things go altogether and postpone others for the time being. But if you want not only these great goals but also political power and wealth, the chances are that, in aiming at the former, you won’t get even the latter; and you’ll certainly fail to get the former, which are the only things from which we get freedom and happiness. So take up the practice right now of telling every disagreeable impression, ‘You’re an impression, and not at all what you appear to be.’ Then go on to examine it and assess it by these criteria of yours, and first and foremost by this one: whether it has to do with the things that are up to us or the things that are not up to us. And if it has to do with the things that are not up to us, have at hand the reminder that it’s nothing to you.

## 2

Remember that desire holds out the prospect of getting what you desire, and aversion the prospect of not experiencing what you want to avoid, and that the person who fails in his desire suffers disappointment, while the one who experiences what he wants to avoid suffers misfortune. So if you try to avoid only things that are contrary to nature among the things that are up to you, you’ll meet with none of the things you want to avoid, while if you try to avoid illness or death or poverty, you’ll be miserable. Withdraw aversion, then, from everything that isn’t up to us and redirect it to things that are contrary to nature among the things that are up to us. As for desire, abolish it altogether for the time being, because if you desire something that isn’t up to us, you’re bound to become miserable, and because none of the things that are up to us, that it would be right for you to desire, are yet within your reach. Make use only of inclination and disinclination, but do so with a light touch, with reservation, and with detachment.

## 3

When faced with anything you find attractive, useful, or lovable, remember to tell yourself what kind of thing it is. Start with the least important things. If it’s a jug you like, say, ‘I like a jug,’ because then you won’t be upset if it gets broken. If you kiss a child of yours or your wife, tell yourself that you’re kissing a human being, because then you won’t be upset if they die.

## 4

Whenever you’re about to start on some activity or other, remind yourself of its characteristic features. If you’re going out to bathe, rehearse in your mind what typically happens in a bathhouse—getting splashed and jostled and abused and robbed. It’s safer to set about an activity if you tell yourself: ‘I want to bathe and to keep my will in accord with nature’—and so on for every activity. Then, if something happens that obstructs your bathing, you’ll have at hand the reminder that ‘That wasn’t the only thing I wanted; I also wanted to keep my will in accord with nature. And I won’t be doing that if I resent what’s happening.’

## 5

People are troubled not by things but by their judgments about things. Death, for example, isn’t frightening, or else Socrates would have thought it so. No, what frightens people is their judgment about death, that it’s something to fear. So whenever we’re obstructed or troubled or distressed, let’s blame no one but ourselves—that is, our judgments.

5b

Blaming others when things are going badly for him is what an uneducated person does. Blaming himself is what a partially educated person does. Blaming neither others nor himself is what a fully educated person does.

## 6

Don’t take pride in any distinction that isn’t your own. If a horse were proudly to say ‘I’m beautiful,’ that would be acceptable. But when you proudly say, ‘I own a beautiful horse,’ you must realize that what you’re taking pride in is a horse’s good quality. So what is yours? Making use of impressions. And so, when you’re in accord with nature in the use you make of impressions, that can be a source of pride, because then you’ll be taking pride in something good that’s yours.

## 7

Suppose you’re traveling by sea and the boat puts in somewhere, and you disembark to get some water. While you’re at it you might also pick up a bit of shellfish and a few bulbs, but you have to keep your mind fixed on the boat and pay constant attention in case the captain calls you back, and, if the call comes, you have to leave all those things behind to avoid being tied up and hoisted on board like the sheep. The same goes for life too. Suppose you’ve been given, not bulbs and shellfish, but a wife and child. All well and good, but if the captain calls, run to the boat, leaving all those things behind, without paying them any mind. And, if you’re elderly, you also shouldn’t ever stray far from the boat, in case the call comes and you get left behind.

## 8

Instead of wishing that things would happen as you’d like, wish that they would happen as they do, and then you’ll be content.

## 9

Illness may impair the body, but it doesn’t impair the will unless the will wishes it. Lameness is an impairment of the leg, but it doesn’t impair the will. Whatever happens to you, tell yourself this and you’ll find that it’s always something else that’s impaired, not yourself.

## 10

In every situation, remember to turn to yourself and try to find what means you have for dealing with it. If you see an attractive man or woman, you’ll find that self-control is the appropriate faculty. If you’re in pain, you’ll find it to be fortitude. If someone’s maligning you, you’ll find it to be patience. If you make this your habitual practice, you won’t be carried away by your impressions.

## 11

Never say ‘I’ve lost it’ about anything, but ‘I’ve returned it.’ Has your child died? It has been returned. Has your wife died? She has been returned. Has your estate been confiscated? So that too has been returned. ‘But the person who confiscated it is a bad man.’ What difference does it make to you whom the donor used as the agent of its return? As long as they’re in your charge, treat them as things that belong to someone else, as travelers treat an inn.

## 12

If you want to make progress, discard thoughts such as ‘If I neglect my affairs, I’ll have nothing to eat’ and ‘If I don’t punish my slave, he’ll turn out badly.’ It’s better to starve to death without distress and fear than to live in affluence with a troubled mind, and it’s better for your slave to be bad than for you to be unhappy. Start with trivial things, then. A little olive oil is spilled, a little wine is stolen. Tell yourself: ‘This is the price I pay for equanimity and peace of mind. Nothing comes for free.’ And when you call for your slave, bear in mind the possibility that he might not respond, or that he might respond but do something quite different from what you want. But he’s not important enough for your peace of mind to depend on him.

## 13

If you want to make progress, put up with being thought foolish and simpleminded about outward things. Don’t yearn to be regarded as any kind of expert. Even if others take you to be a person of some importance, doubt yourself. For it’s not easy, believe me, to keep your will in compliance with nature and also to secure external things for yourself. If you care about the one, you’re bound to neglect the other.

## 14

It’s foolish to want your children, your wife, and your friends to live no matter what, because you’re wanting things that aren’t up to you to be up to you, and things that aren’t yours to be yours. By the same token, it’s stupid to want your slave not to do wrong, because that’s wanting badness not to be badness but something else. But if you want to get what you desire, that’s in your power. So confine your efforts to what’s in your power.

14b

An individual’s master is the person who has the power of procuring for him or denying to him what he wants or doesn’t want. So anyone who wants to be free must neither want nor try to avoid anything that’s up to others. Otherwise, he’s bound to be unfree.

## 15

Remember that you ought to behave in life as you do at a dinner party. Something is making the rounds and comes to you: reach out your hand and modestly take some of it. It moves on: don’t hold it back. It hasn’t arrived yet: don’t project your desire onto it in advance, but wait your turn. That’s how to behave toward children, wife, high offices, wealth. Then you’ll deserve to dine with the gods someday. And if you don’t even take these things when they’re offered to you but scorn them, then you won’t only dine with the gods but share their rule. It was by acting like this that Diogenes, Heraclitus, and others like them earned the right to be and be recognized as godlike men.

## 16

Whenever you see someone†1 weeping out of grief for the departure of a child or because he’s lost some property, make sure you don’t get carried away by the impression that his external circumstances really are bad. Instead, have at hand the reminder that ‘It’s not what’s happened that’s distressing him (otherwise it would distress everyone), but his judgment about what’s happened.’ Don’t hesitate, however, to sympathize with him verbally, and even to mourn along with him, if that is what the occasion calls for. But make sure that you don’t mourn inwardly as well.

## 17

Remember that you’re an actor in a play that is just as the producer wants it to be. If he wants it short, it’s short; if he wants it long, it’s long. If he wants you to play a beggar, see that you play even this part proficiently—or a cripple, or a ruler, or a nobody. It’s your job to act the role you’ve been assigned well, but the role was chosen by someone else.

## 18

When a raven croaks ominously, don’t let the impression carry you away, but immediately draw a distinction in your mind and say: ‘None of these omens have any significance for me, but only for my body, my property, my reputation, my children, or my wife. But every omen is propitious for me if I so wish, because, whatever the outcome, it’s up to me to benefit from it.’

## 19

You have the potential to be invincible. All you have to do is never enter a contest where victory isn’t up to you.

19b

When you see someone being preferred for an official position ahead of you, or possessing great power, or in general enjoying high status, make sure that you never get carried away by the impression and think him fortunate. If the essence of goodness is one of the things that’s up to us, there’s no room for envy or jealousy, and you won’t wish yourself to be a praetor, a senator, or a consul, but a free man. And there’s only one route to that, which is regarding things that aren’t up to us as unimportant.

## 20

Remember that what’s making you feel insulted isn’t this person’s rudeness or that one’s blows, but your judgment that they’re insulting you. Whenever someone irritates you, then, realize that it’s the belief that’s irritating you. It follows that the first thing to do is to try not to be carried away by the impression. Once you pause and bide your time, you’ll find it easier to control yourself.

## 21

Make it a daily practice to picture to yourself death, exile, and everything else that seems terrifying—especially death. Then you’ll never have a contemptible thought or crave anything too much.

## 22

Anyone with philosophical aspirations must immediately accept the fact that he’s going to meet with a lot of ridicule and mockery. ‘Look who’s back!’ they’ll say. ‘And now he’s a philosopher all of a sudden!’ And ‘How did he get so hoity-toity?’ You mustn’t act superior, then, but hold fast to the things that seem best to you, knowing that where you are is where you’ve been assigned by God. And remember that if you keep this up, the people who formerly mocked you will come to admire you. But if you let them get the better of you, you’ll make yourself doubly ridiculous.

## 23

If you should ever find yourself turning outward because you want someone to think well of you, you can be sure that you’ve lost your bearings. Be satisfied, then, with always being a philosopher. And if you also want to be thought to be one, you don’t need anyone else but yourself to think so.

## 24

Don’t distress yourself with thoughts such as ‘I shall live a life without public honors, a complete nobody.’ Even supposing that lack of honor is a bad thing . . .

Which it is.†2

. . . no one other than yourself can be responsible for your being in a bad state, just as only you can be responsible for your being in a shameful state. Now, it’s not up to you to be appointed to public office or invited to a banquet, is it?

Of course not.

Therefore, if dishonor is bad, this can’t constitute being dishonored, can it? Moreover, you won’t, of course, be a nobody everywhere, seeing that the only place where you have to be is where things are up to you, and there it’s possible for you to be number one.

But I won’t be in a position to help my friends.†3

What do you mean by that? They won’t receive any cash handouts from you and you won’t get them Roman citizenship. But from where did you get the idea that these are among the things that are up to us, not someone else’s doing? And can anyone give anyone else something that he himself doesn’t have? ‘Get money, then,’ someone says, ‘so that we can have some too.’ If I can get it while retaining my self-respect, trustworthiness, and high-mindedness, show me the way and I’ll get some. But if you’re asking me to lose my good qualities so that you can get things that aren’t good, you can see how unfair and unfeeling you’re being. What would you rather have, money or a trustworthy and self-respecting friend? Better for you to take me as I am, without asking me to act in ways that will cause me to lose these qualities.

But my country will be deprived of all the help I could have given it, he said.

Again, in this regard too, what kind of help do you mean? You won’t have provided it with porticoes or bathhouses, but so what? I mean, the blacksmith doesn’t supply its footwear or the cobbler its weaponry. It’s enough if everyone does their own job. And if you were to equip it with another trustworthy and self-respecting citizen, wouldn’t you be doing it good?

Yes.

So you wouldn’t be of no use to it either.

So what position shall I hold in it?

Any position you can hold while at the same time preserving your trustworthiness and self-respect. But if in your desire to do it some good you lose those qualities and end up untrustworthy and with no sense of shame, what use would you be to it?

## 25

If someone has been preferred to you at a banquet or a reception line or in being called on for advice, you should be pleased at his success, if these accolades are good to have. And if they’re bad, don’t be angry that the success wasn’t yours. And remember that you can’t think you deserve an equal share unless you act the same way as others do in pursuit of things that aren’t up to us. If someone doesn’t regularly make his way to a patron’s door, or join his retinue, or sing his praises, how can he have the same share as someone who does all these things? It would be unfair and greedy of you not to pay the going price for these distinctions and to want to get them for nothing. How much does a head of lettuce cost? Let’s say an obol. So if someone pays the obol and gets a lettuce, while you don’t have a lettuce because you haven’t paid for it, you shouldn’t think that you have less than him. After all, although he has the lettuce, you have the unspent obol. It’s the same for the accolades we’re talking about. You weren’t invited to someone’s banquet? That’s because you didn’t give the host the price he demands for the meal. He sells it for flattery, for service. Pay the going price, if it’s in your interest to do so. But if you want to have the goods without paying for them, you’re being greedy and stupid. Do you have nothing, then, in place of the dinner? Well, what you’ve gained is that you didn’t flatter the man you didn’t want to flatter, and didn’t have to suffer the people at his doorway.

## 26

It’s possible to understand what nature wants from situations where we’re no different from other people. For example, when a slave breaks someone else’s cup, we’re instantly ready to say ‘These things happen.’ So when it’s a cup of yours that gets broken, appreciate that you should have the same attitude as when it’s someone else’s cup. Transfer the principle to things of greater importance. Has someone else’s child or wife died? There’s no one who wouldn’t say ‘So it goes.’ But when it’s one’s own child or wife who’s died, the automatic response is ‘Oh, no!’ and ‘Poor me!’ It’s essential to remember how we feel when we hear of this happening to others.

## 27

Just as a target isn’t set up in order to be missed, so also badness isn’t a natural feature of the world.

## 28

If someone gave your body into the keeping of a passerby, you’d be furious. But you give your mind into the keeping of any random person, so that, if he maligns you, it becomes troubled and confused. Doesn’t this make you feel ashamed?

## 29

In every project you undertake, consider what preliminaries are required and the consequences before proceeding to act. Otherwise, you’ll make an enthusiastic start, because you won’t have given any thought to what comes next, and then later you’ll shamefully†4 abandon the project when faced with some of the consequences. You’d like to be a victor at the Olympic Games? Good heavens, so would I! That would really be fine! But consider the project from start to finish before setting about it. You have to be disciplined, maintain a strict diet, give up sweet pastries, undergo a strict training regime, exercise regularly every day however hot or cold it may be, refrain from cold drinks, drink no wine except when prescribed. In short, you have to submit to a trainer as you would to a doctor. Then, during the contest, you have to wield a spade,†5 risk dislocating a wrist or spraining an ankle, swallow a lot of sand, possibly get flogged, and, as if all that wasn’t enough, possibly suffer defeat as well.

Once you’ve taken all this into consideration, go and compete if you still want to. If you don’t, your behavior will be comparable to that of children, who at one moment pretend they’re wrestlers and at another gladiators, then they’re blowing trumpets, and then they’re actors in a play. That’s what you’re like as well: at one moment an athlete, at the next a gladiator, then an orator, then a philosopher—without committing yourself wholeheartedly to anything. Like an ape, you imitate every passing thing you see, and one thing after another attracts you. You don’t think through any of your projects or look at them in the round; you act without purpose and without really wanting anything.

This is no different from how some people, after seeing a philosopher and hearing one of them speaking as persuasively as Euphrates (not that anyone can really speak like him), want to take up philosophy themselves. Man, first consider what kind of venture it is and then your own nature, to see if you’ve got what it takes. You’d like to be a pentathlete or a wrestler? Look at your arms, your thighs, your loins. Different people are naturally suited for different things. Do you think that, doing what you do now, you can be a philosopher? Do you think you can eat and drink as you do now, or get angry or irritated as you do now? As a philosopher, you have to go without sleep, work hard, and withdraw from friends and family; you’ll find yourself sneered at by slaves, mocked by everyone, and inferior in everything—in honor, in political power, in the courts, and in every worldly enterprise. Once you’ve taken all this into consideration, see if you want to exchange these external things for equanimity, freedom, and peace of mind. And if you don’t, steer clear of philosophy. Don’t act as children do and be a philosopher today, a tax collector tomorrow, then an orator, and then an imperial procurator. These things don’t fit well together. You must be one person, whether good or bad. You have to choose between cultivating your†6 command center or the outside world—between exercising your ingenuity on inner things or outer things, or in other words between taking up a stance as a philosopher or as a man of the world.

## 30

The actions it’s appropriate for us to take are generally given by our relationships. He’s a father: this means that we have to look after him, let him have his way in everything, and put up with his rebukes and beatings. ‘But he’s a bad father.’ Do you really think you have affinity only for a good father, and not just for a father? Is your brother doing you wrong? Then don’t let that affect your stance toward him. Don’t think about his behavior but about what you can do to keep your will in accord with nature. After all, no one can harm you unless you let him; you’ll have been harmed only when you believe yourself to be harmed. In this way, then, if you get into the habit of considering your relationships, you’ll learn from a fellow citizen, from a neighbor, from a commanding officer what actions it’s appropriate for you to take.

## 31

You should know that the most important aspect of piety toward the gods is having correct beliefs about them—that they exist, and that they govern the universe well and justly—and the second most important thing is to have set yourself to obey them, or in other words to submit and willingly accommodate yourself to everything that happens, knowing that it’s being brought about by a flawless intelligence. In this way, you’ll never either criticize the gods or accuse them of neglecting you. But it’s impossible for this to happen unless you detach goodness and badness from things that aren’t up to us and locate them only in things that are up to us. You can be sure that if you believe anything that isn’t up to you to be good or bad, it’s absolutely inevitable that, when you fail to get what you want and meet with what you don’t want, you’ll blame and curse those who are responsible. The point is that it’s natural for every creature to flee and turn away from things that it takes to be harmful and what is responsible for them, and to pursue and value beneficial things and what is responsible for them. So it’s as inconceivable for anyone who thinks he’s being harmed to welcome what he believes is harming him as it is impossible for him to welcome the harm itself. That’s why even a father is maligned by a son when he doesn’t let the boy have something that he judges to be good; and Eteocles and Poly nices were the product of the belief that sole rule is a good thing. It is also why farmers curse the gods, as do sailors, traders, and men who’ve lost their wives and children. Self-interest and piety are inextricably linked. So whoever takes care to have the proper desires and aversions is at the same time taking care to be pious. But there’s no one for whom the traditional practices of pouring libations, performing sacrifices, and offering first fruits are inappropriate, if he carries them out after purifying himself, not in a perfunctory or slipshod manner, and without either being stingy or spending beyond his means.

## 32

Whenever you consult a seer, remember that, although you don’t know what future will be predicted (that’s what you’ve gone to find out from the seer), you’re already in a position, if you’re a philosopher, to know what kind of future it will be. I mean, since it’s something that isn’t up to us, there can be absolutely no doubt that it’ll be neither good nor bad. So don’t bring your desires and aversions to the seer (otherwise you’ll approach him trembling with anxiety), but go to him in the knowledge that any outcome, whatever it may be, will be a matter of indifference and nothing to you. The point is that you’ll be able to make good use of it and no one can stop you doing so. Approach the gods with confidence, then, regarding them as counselors, and from now on, whenever you’ve been given a piece of advice, remember whom you’ve accepted as your counselors and whom you’ll be ignoring if you don’t take the advice.

Have recourse to divination in a way that would meet Socrates’s approval—that is, for cases where the whole purpose of the inquiry is to learn what the future holds, and neither reason nor skill of any kind supplies one with the resources to find out about the matter in question. So, when you have to share the risk faced by a friend or your country, don’t expect divination to tell you whether you should share the risk. I mean, even if the seer warns you that the omens are unfavorable, clearly portending death, the mutilation of some part of your body, or exile—nevertheless, reason requires that, even in the face of such risks, you should stand by your friend and play your part at this time of danger for your country. Pay attention, then, to the greatest seer, Pythian Apollo, who threw out of his temple the man who failed to help when his friend was being killed.

## 33

Starting now, prescribe a certain character and form for yourself which you’ll maintain both when you’re by yourself and when you’re with other people.

Keep silence for the most part, or speak only when necessary and briefly. On those rare occasions when the situation requires you to say something, speak,†7 but not about just anything—not about gladiatorial shows, horse races, athletes, food, or drink, the ubiquitous topics of conversation. Above all, don’t talk about other people: don’t criticize them, praise them, or compare them to others. If you can, redirect your conversation and that of the people you’re with onto an appropriate topic, but if you happen to find yourself alone among people who are of a different kind than you, remain silent.

Laugh little—that is, at few things and discreetly. Avoid swearing oaths altogether, if that’s possible, or at least as much as you can. Steer clear of parties where the guests are outsiders and non-philosophers. But if you find yourself at one, take great care not to slip back into unphilosophical ways. After all, you can be certain that anyone who brushes against a companion who’s dirty is bound to get dirty, even if he happens to be clean.

In things relating to the body, such as food, drink, clothing, housing, and household staff, limit yourself to what satisfies your basic needs, and cut out everything that’s pretentious or self-indulgent. As for sex, keep yourself as chaste as possible before marriage, and if you do engage in it, keep it within conventional bounds. But don’t abuse or criticize those who are sexually active, and don’t advertise your own abstinence all over the place.

If you’re informed that someone or other is speaking ill of you, don’t defend yourself against the allegations, but respond by saying: ‘Well, he must be unaware of my other faults, otherwise these wouldn’t have been the only ones he mentioned.’

[10] You shouldn’t feel obliged to go often to the public games, but if you find yourself there, make it clear that you favor no one except yourself. By this I mean that you should want only what happens to happen and want only the winner to win, because then you won’t be frustrated. But refrain altogether from shouting and laughing at anyone, or getting overexcited. And after you’ve left, don’t discuss what happened at any length, because that kind of thing makes people think that you found the show admirable. Confine yourself to bringing up those experiences that were relevant to your own moral improvement.

[11] Don’t go casually, without having some purpose, to people’s public readings and lectures, but if you do go, preserve your dignity and self-possession, while making sure at the same time that you don’t give offense.

[12] When you’re about to meet someone, especially someone thought to be important, ask yourself what Socrates or Zeno would have done in this situation, and then you won’t be at a loss as to how to make appropriate use of the occasion. [13] And when you go to call on someone high and mighty, tell yourself that you won’t find him at home, that you’ll be shut out, that the door will be slammed in your face, and that he won’t take any notice of you. If, despite all this, it’s appropriate for you to go, then go; put up with what happens and never tell yourself that it wasn’t worth so much aggravation. That’s what a non-philosopher would do, someone who misconceives the external world.

[14] In company, avoid frequent and excessive mention of your own activities and ventures. It may be enjoyable for you to talk about your ventures, but it’s less enjoyable for others to hear what’s happened to you. [15] Also, don’t try to be funny. It’s a slippery slope that easily descends into vulgarity, and at the same time it’s a good way to lessen the respect you receive from those around you. [16] It’s also dangerous to lapse into lewdness. When anything like that occurs, if the opportunity arises, you should even scold the person who introduced it into the conversation. If you can’t do that, you should at least demonstrate by your silence, blushing, and frowning that you find what’s been said distasteful.

## 34

Whenever an impression of a pleasure occurs to you, make sure, just as with all other impressions, that you don’t get carried away by it. Let the thing wait; allow yourself a pause. Then think about both times—the time when you’ll be enjoying the pleasant feeling, and the time after that, the time of subsequent regret and self-criticism—and compare them to the gratification and self-satisfaction you’ll feel if you abstain. But if you do think that it’s the right time for that particular action, be careful not to be overwhelmed by its charm and allure. Set against its attractions how much better it is to be conscious of having won this victory.

## 35

When you’ve decided that something needs to be done and you do it, never try to conceal the fact that you’re doing it, even if it’s something that most people are going to have a negative opinion about. I mean, if what you’re doing is wrong, avoid doing it altogether, but if it’s right, why worry about misplaced criticism?

## 36

Just as the propositions ‘It is day’ and ‘It is night’ are valuable for asserting a disjunction but have negative value for a conjunction, so likewise taking a larger portion of food may have value for your body, but it has disvalue for preserving the friendly atmosphere of a dinner party as one should. So when you’re dining in company, remember to consider not only the value for your body of the dishes but also the value for your host of your being properly restrained.†8

## 37

If you take on a role that’s beyond your capabilities, you not only disgrace yourself in that one, but you’ve also passed up the role that you were capable of performing well.

## 38

When you go for a walk, you’re careful not to step on a nail or twist your ankle, and you should be just as careful to avoid harming your command center. If we’re on our guard in this respect, we’ll set about whatever we do in greater safety.

## 39

Everyone’s body is the measure of his property, just as a foot is the measure of a shoe. If you abide by this rule, you’ll preserve due measure, but if you transgress it, you’re bound to end up walking off a cliff, so to speak. It’s the same as with a shoe: if you go beyond the requirements of the foot, you get a gilded shoe, and then one dyed purple, and then an embroidered one. Once you go beyond the measure, there’s no end to it.

Women are addressed by men as ‘mistress’ as soon as they’re fourteen years old, and so, when they see that their only lot is to become men’s bedfellows, they begin to beautify themselves and pin all their hopes on their looks. So it’s worth making sure that they realize that the only thing that will earn them men’s esteem is their appearing modest and self-respecting.

## 41

It’s a sign of coarseness to spend a lot of time on bodily functions such as exercising, eating, drinking, defecating, and copulating. These are things to be done incidentally; all your attention should be on your intellect.

## 42

Whenever anyone does you wrong or speaks ill of you, remember that he acts and speaks as he does because he thinks it’s appropriate for him. He can only conform to his own views, not to yours. So if his views are wrong, he’s the one who’s harmed, because he’s also been deceived. If someone takes a true conjunctive statement to be false, it’s not the conjunctive statement that has been harmed but the person who’s mistaken. If your inclinations to act are based on these principles, you’ll be gentler with anyone who maligns you, because whenever that happens you’ll tell yourself: ‘That’s what he thought it best to do.’

## 43

Everything has two handles, one of which makes it bearable, the other unbearable. If your brother’s treating you badly, don’t take hold of the fact that he’s mistreating you, because that’s the handle that makes it unbearable, but take hold rather of the fact that he’s your brother, that you grew up together. Then you’ll be holding the situation by what makes it bearable.

## 44

These statements are invalid: ‘I’m richer than you, and that means I’m superior to you’; ‘I’m more eloquent than you, and that means I’m superior to you.’ On the other hand, the following inferences are valid: ‘I’m richer than you, and that means my property is superior to yours’; ‘I’m more eloquent than you, and that means my diction is superior to yours.’ But you yourself are neither your property nor your diction.

## 45

Someone is bathing hurriedly: don’t say that he’s bathing ‘badly,’ only ‘hurriedly.’ Someone is drinking a lot of wine: don’t say that he’s drinking ‘badly,’ only ‘a lot.’ Until you know how he judges things, how can you know if he’s acting badly? Then the upshot will be that you won’t be receiving cognitive impressions of some things while giving your assent to others.

## 46

Under no circumstances call yourself a philosopher, and when you’re among non-philosophers, talk little about philosophical theories. Just act in accordance with those theories. At a dinner party, for instance, don’t talk about the proper way of eating, but just eat properly. Remember that Socrates had so thoroughly eliminated display that people used to come to him because they wanted him to introduce them to philosophers, and he would effect the introduction in person. That’s how little it bothered him to be unrecognized himself. If, when you’re among non-philosophers, a philosophical theory crops up in the conversation, say very little, because there’s a good chance that before very long you’ll be spewing up undigested material. And when someone accuses you of ignorance, if it doesn’t bother you, then, believe me, you’ve made a start on the work. Sheep don’t produce grass to show their shepherds how much they’ve eaten, but they digest their food inwardly, and produce wool and milk outwardly. You too, then, shouldn’t flaunt your theoretical views to nonphilosophers, but show them only the actions that result from those theories once they’ve been digested.

## 47

When you’ve become accustomed to reducing your bodily needs, don’t flaunt it. If you’re a teetotaler, don’t seize every opportunity to let people know that you’re a teetotaler. If you want to train yourself to endure physical hardship, do so for yourself, not for others. Don’t hug statues! Instead, when you’re parched with thirst, take cold water into your mouth and spit it out again—without telling anyone.

## 48

The position and character of a non-philosopher: never expect benefit or harm to come from oneself, but only from the outside world. The position and character of a philosopher: only ever expect benefit and harm to come from oneself.

48b

The signs that a person is making progress: no criticism of others, no praise of others, no blaming others, no reproaching others, and no talking about himself as though he had any standing or knowledge. When he’s obstructed or impeded, he finds fault with himself. If someone praises him, he laughs inwardly at the person doing so. If he’s criticized, he doesn’t defend himself. He treats himself like an invalid, taking care not to move any of his healing limbs before they’ve set. He has rid himself of every desire and has transferred his aversion entirely onto things that are contrary to nature and up to us. He manages all his inclinations with a light touch. If people take him to be simpleminded or ignorant, he doesn’t care. In a word, he treats himself with circumspection, as though he were an enemy intriguing against himself.

## 49

When someone prides himself on his ability to understand and explain Chrysippus’s works, tell yourself: ‘If Chrysippus hadn’t written so unclearly, this person wouldn’t have anything to feel proud about.’ But let’s look at my case. What is it that I want? To understand nature and make it my guide. So I look for someone to explain things to me, and because I’ve heard that Chrysippus does that, I turn to him. But I don’t understand what he’s written, so I look for someone to interpret it. So far, nothing to be proud of. But when I’ve found an interpreter, there’s still the matter of putting the precepts into practice; that’s the only thing to be proud of. But if what I prize is just the interpreting itself, haven’t I ended up as a literary critic rather than a philosopher, with the only difference being that I explicate Chrysippus rather than Homer? So when someone asks me to expound some passage of Chrysippus, I blush at my inability to show him that my actions reflect and are consistent with the words I’m reading.

## 50

Stick with every goal you set yourself as you would abide by laws—that is, regarding it as wicked to transgress any of them. Don’t worry about what people will say about you, because that’s no longer your business.

## 51

For how long will you go on deferring the time when you demand the best of yourself and put an end to transgressing right reason? You’ve accepted the theories. You’ve subscribed to the views to which you ought to subscribe. What kind of teacher are you still expecting, that you postpone the correction of yourself until he’s there to do it for you? You’re not a child anymore but a grown man. If you’re remiss and lazy now—if you constantly find one reason after another for delay and make each successive day the day when you’ll start working on yourself—you’ll imperceptibly fail to make progress, and in the end you’ll have lived and died without committing yourself to philosophy. Now is the time, then, for you to choose to live as an adult and as one who is making progress as a philosopher. Now is the time for you to regard everything you know to be best as a law that you’re bound to obey. And, in the event that you’re faced with something painful or pleasant, or something that will enhance or damage your reputation, remember that the contest is on—that here, now, are the Olympic Games, that procrastination is no longer an option, and that just one defeat and surrender determines whether your progress is ruined or remains intact. That’s how Socrates got to be the person he was, by urging himself under all circumstances to pay attention to nothing other than reason. You may not yet be Socrates, but you ought to live as someone who wants to be Socrates.

## 52

The first and most necessary aspect of philosophy is the one that has to do with the application of theories such as ‘Don’t tell lies.’ The second has to do with proofs, such as why one shouldn’t lie. The third confirms and analyzes the proofs by asking what makes this particular argument a proof: what is it to be a proof, what is entailment, incompatibility, truth, falsehood? So the third aspect is necessary because of the second, and the second because of the first, and the one that’s most necessary, and is therefore the one over which we should be spending time, is the first. But we get it all back to front. We linger over the third aspect and put all our efforts into that, while utterly neglecting the first. And the upshot is that we tell lies, while being thoroughly conversant with how to prove that we shouldn’t lie.

## 53

We must always have at hand the following sentiments:

‘Lead me, Zeus, both you and Destiny,

Wheresoe’r you have ordained for me,

And I shall gladly follow. And if I am unwilling

Out of wickedness, still I shall follow.’

‘Whoever complies nobly with necessity

We count as wise and expert in the ways of the gods.’

‘Well, Crito, if this is pleasing to the gods, so be it.’ ‘Anytus and Meletus may be able to kill me, but they cannot harm me.’
