At the start of the day tell yourself: I shall meet people who are officious, ungrateful, abusive, treacherous, malicious, and selfish. In every case, they’ve got like this because of their ignorance of good and bad. But I have seen goodness and badness for what they are, and I know that what is good is what is morally right, and what is bad is what is morally wrong;and I’ve seen the true nature of the wrongdoer himself and know that he’s related to me—not in the sense that we share blood and seed, but by virtue of the fact that we both partake of the same intelligence, and so of a portion of the divine. None of them can harm me, anyway, because none of them can infect me with immorality,nor can I become angry with someone who’s related to me, or hate him, because we were born to work together, like feet or hands or eyelids, like the rows of upper and lower teeth. To work against each other is therefore unnatural—and anger and rejection count as “working against.”

This thing that I am, whatever we are to call it, is flesh, spirit, and the command center. Forget your books—and don’t let it upset you—that’s not allowed. Instead, as one on the point of death, despise the flesh: it’s just blood, bones, and a network of nerves, veins, and arteries. Then consider what spirit is: no more than air, and never constant, continually belched out and gulped back in again. So that leaves the third ingredient, the command center. Look at it this way: you’re elderly; put an end to allowing its enslavement; put an end to being tugged here and there like a puppet at the prompting of selfish impulses; put an end to both complaining about your present fate and shrinking from the future.

The gods’ works are filled with providence; the works of fortune aren’t independent of nature or of the interlacing and intertwining of things under the direction of providence. It is the source of everything, including necessity and the well-being of the universe, the whole of which you are a part. What is good for every part of nature is what is supplied by the nature of the whole and what preserves the whole; and what preserves the whole is the changing of the compounds no less than the changing of the physical elements. Be content with these doctrines; make them your constant guiding principles. Get over your thirst for books, so that you don’t die grumbling, but with true serenity and with heartfelt gratitude to the gods.

## 4

Remember how long you’ve been putting this off and how often the gods have given you due dates of which you’ve not taken advantage. It’s high time now for you to recognize what kind of universe you’re a part of, and what kind of universal directing power you’re an emanation of, and that a limit has been set on your time, and if you don’t use it to dispel the mists it will pass, and you will pass, and the opportunity won’t come again.

## 5

You must always consider, with Roman and masculine doggedness, how to tackle any matter that arises with scrupulous and unfeigned grace, affection for others, generosity, and justice, and how to spend no time over all other incoming impressions. That will happen if you treat every act as though it were the last of your life17—which is to say, if you’re free from all stray thoughtsand from any deviation, under the influence of passion, from the principles established by reason, and if you’re free from hypocrisy, self-love, and dissatisfaction with your lot. And look! There are only a few things that a person has to master in order to gain the ability to live a contented and god-fearing life. Even the gods will require nothing more from someone who adheres to these few principles.

## 6

Treat yourself with contempt, soul of mine—yes, contempt! The time has passed for you to respect yourself. For no one lives long, and this life of yours is all but spent while you dishonor yourself and make your happiness depend on the souls of others.

## 7

Do you get sidetracked when external things intrude? Free yourself from them, in favor of learning something new and worthwhile, and stop your purposeless wandering. But now there’s another kind of meandering that you need to guard against: people who’ve become world-weary, and lack a goal to which they can direct every impulse and, in general, every impression, act in ways that are as meaningless as their words.

## 8

One doesn’t commonly see people becoming miserable as a result of not taking note of what’s going on in someone else’s soul, but anyone who’s unaware of the activity of his own soul can’t help but be miserable.

## 9

Here are things you should always bear in mind: what the nature of the whole is; what my nature is; how my nature is related to the nature of the whole; what kind of part it is of what kind of whole; and that no one is stopping you from being in accord with the nature of which you are a part, in all you ever say or do.

## 10

Theophrastus spoke as a true philosopher when, in the course of his comparison of offenses (a comparative exercise that is quite commonly undertaken),he said that the sins of desire were more serious than the sins of anger. He argued that an angry man abandons reason because he’s distressed, experiencing some internal psychic contraction,while a man whose wrongdoing is caused by desire is more self-indulgent, because he’s been defeated by pleasure,and is less manly in his wrongdoing. He was right, then, and thinking like a philosopher, to say that wrongdoing that’s accompanied by pleasure is more deserving of blame than wrongdoing that’s accompanied by distress. To put it generally, the latter case seems to be one where someone has had wrong done to him first, and his pain compelled him to get angry, whereas in the former case he felt impelled of his own accord to do wrong and acted as he did because he was carried along by desire.

## 11

Everything you do and say and think should be predicated on the possibility of your imminent departure from life. But, if the gods exist,leaving this world can’t be something to fear, because they wouldn’t let anything bad happen to you. On the other hand, if they don’t exist or have no care for the human race, why live in such a world, devoid of gods and divine providence?But in fact they do exist and they do care for the human race, and they’ve made it entirely up to each of us to avoid experiencing anything truly bad. And if anything else were bad, they would also have made sure that it was our choice whether or not to experience that too. (But how could a man’s life be made worse by anything that doesn’t make him a worse person?)The universe would have neglected this only if it were ignorant, or if it had knowledge but lacked the ability to guard against it or correct it; but neither of these is the case. Nor could it have committed such a great wrong, out of either impotence or incompetence, as to let good and bad things be the lot equally of good and bad people without distinction. But death and life, glory and obscurity, pain and pleasure, wealth and poverty—all these things come to good and bad people alike, since they are morally neutral in themselves, and this proves that they’re neither good nor bad.

## 12

How rapidly everything vanishes, physical bodies lost in the universe and the memory of them lost in eternity! Look at the nature of every object we perceive, especially those that entice us with the prospect of pleasure, frighten us with the prospect of pain, or are celebrated by humans in their vanity! How worthless, vile, sordid, and short-lived things are, just corpses!It is for the intellectual faculty to consider what kind of people they are, those whose views and voices confer fame or obscurity; what death is, and the fact that, if one sees it for what it is and, by analyzing the concept, dissolves the impressions that adhere to it, one will stop believing it to be anything other than a natural process34—and there’s nothing to fear about natural processes unless you’re a child35—though in fact not only is it a product of nature, but it also does nature good;and how a human being makes contact with God, with what part of himself, and in what condition this part of him must be to do so.

## 13

There’s nothing more pathetic than a man who’s always running around and poking his nose in everywhere—investigating “the nether regions of the earth,” in the poet’s words37—and using outside signs to infer what’s going on in his neighbors’ souls, without realizing that all he needs to do is focus on his own inner guardian spiritand take proper care of it. Caring for it is keeping it unsullied by passion, purposelessness, and dissatisfaction with the activities of gods and men; for the goodness of the gods is such that their acts are to be respected, and human kinship means that men’s acts are to be welcomed. There are times, however, when human acts are also rather pitiful because of their ignorance of good and bad, which is as much of a disability as being blind to the difference between white and black.

## 14

Even if you were to live for three thousand years or ten times as long, remember that the only life anyone loses is this one, the one he’s living, and the only life anyone lives is the one he loses. It follows that the longest life and the shortest life come to the same thing. The present moment is equal for all, and therefore its passing is equal for all, and therefore what is lost turns out to be a mere instant. After all, no one can lose either the past or the future, because no one can lose what he doesn’t have. So there are two points for you always to bear in mind: first, that everything is the same in kind throughout all eternity, and recurs cyclically,and that it makes no difference how long you see these same things, whether it’s a hundred years or two hundred years or infinite time; second, that both the longest-lived and the shortest-lived lose an equal amount of time, because the present is the only thing one can lose, since that is all one has, and no one can lose what he does not have.

## 15

“Everything is as you take it to be.”As a response to Monimus the Cynic, this is self-evident, but the value of the saying is also obvious, if one accepts what is wholesome about it, its truth and no more.

## 16

The human soul dishonors itself, first and foremost, when it becomes, to the extent that it can, a growth and a tumor, as it were, on the universe. To resent anything that happens is to set oneself apart from nature, of which the various individual natures of everything else are parts. A second case is when it rejects another human being or even opposes him with malicious intent; this is what the souls of angry people are like. Third, it dishonors itself when it’s defeated by pleasure or pain. Fourth, when it dissembles and does or says anything in an affected or dishonest manner. Fifth, when it fails to direct any of its actions or impulses toward a goal, but instead acts without purpose and without attention, when even the slightest actions should be carried out with reference to the end. And the end for rational beings is to follow the reason and rule of the most venerable of all cities and communities.

## 17

A person’s lifetime is a moment, his existence a flowing stream,his perception dull, the entire fabric of his body readily subject to decay, his soul an aimless wanderer, his fortune erratic, his fame uncertain. In short: the body is nothing but a river; the soul is dream and delusion; life is war and a sojourn in a strange land; and oblivion is all there is to posthumous fame. What, then, can escort us safely on our way? Only one thing: philosophy. This consists in keeping the guardian spirit within us safe from assault and harm, never swayed by pleasure or pain, purposeful when it acts, free from dishonesty or dissemblance, and never dependent on action or inaction from anyone else. It also consists in accepting what happens, the lot one has been assigned, as coming from the same source as oneself, and in always awaiting death with a serene mind, understanding that it’s no more than the disintegration of the elements of which every living creature is a compound. If there’s nothing unusual in the elements themselves changing moment by moment one into another, why should the alteration and disintegration of them all be a cause for anxiety? It’s in accord with nature, and nothing that’s in accord with nature is bad.
